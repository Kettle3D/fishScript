			<h1>fishScript</h1>
			<p>
			fishScript is a programming language I'm making.<br>
			I originally started work on fishScript to make it easier to develop <a href="../">Kettle3D</a>, but it didn't really help.
			</p><p>
			This page contains info about fishScript, along with installation instructions and stuff like that.

			<h1>Getting Started with fS</h1>
			<p>
				In order to start programming with fishScript, you'll need a text editor. I'm using VS Code, but Notepad will be fine for this.<br>
				Create a new file called HelloWorld.fS, and open it in your text editor.<br />
				The next thing you'll need to do is write the program. Type the following text into the file:<br>
				<code>
				log Hello, World!
				</code><br>
				Now you need to run it. Download the fishScript compiler from here.<br>
				Then, once you've done that, right-click on HelloWorld.fS, click Open With... > Choose another app > Look for another app on this PC. and browse to where you downloaded the compiler.<br>
<br>
				Ta-daa! You should see a black window with the following text:<br>
				<code>
				|\  __|\___     ==========================================================<br>
				| \/  _  o \    fishScript Compiler v0.1<br>
				| /\  \  ___|   For more info visit https://kettle3d.github.io/fishScript/<br>
				|/  \______/    ==========================================================<br>
<br>
				Hello, World!<br>
				Process ended with exit code 0.<br>
<br>
				Press any key to close this window...<br>
				</code>
				This is what your program does. The log command is used to print text to the screen<br>
